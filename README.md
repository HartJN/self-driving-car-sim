# self-driving-car-sim

A demonstration of neural networks and machine learning with JavaScript. Following Dr. Radu Mariescu-Istodor' course on freeCodeCamp: [Self-Driving Car with JavaScript Course â€“ Neural Networks and Machine Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs_rAxEsAvI)

When clicking the save button, the 'best car' will be stored to local storage.

On next reload, the vehicles will follow the 'best car' path.

When a new car passes 'best cars' location, use the save button again to save as the new 'best car'

Repeat until the vehicle can successfully pass all cars.

## Controls:

controls will be normalised soon.

```markdown
adjust amount of cars: main.js -> Set value of NUM_OF_CARS

increase speed: car.js -> adjust maxSpeed = x in constructor
```

# Aim:

To create a 'self-driving car' simulation, using machine learning and neural networks.

---

# Purpose:

## To learn:

- Neural Networks
- Machine learning basics
- Javascript:
  - canvas api
  - classes
  - private fields
  - static methods

---

# To-Do:

- Automatically save 'best car' state.
- Have 'Car' Recognise lanes
- Change Road layouts, curved, 90-deg, hair-pin, ect
- Add UI controls to adjust amount of vehicles, speed. Via DOM
- Generate traffic at random
- Change car graphic
- Add random events to avoid.
- Traffic lights
- Remove comments and make code self-reading

# How it works: Coming soon.
